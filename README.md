## 📖 Overview
'Vaulted games' is an app that lets users record any and all video games that they may have played, completed or competed in.

The overall idea is for users to be able to log any game title, combined with choice of year and platform they played, as well as being able to rate and rank those gaming experiences.

Maximum flexibilty as to how users can view and organize their game titles has been designed through a sort bar mechanism so that they can choose from the aforementioned platforms, years, ratings and rankings, as well as genres, a-z, z-a, oldest and newest entries.

This is all presented in a retro-gaming aesthetic, with plenty of animations designed, to add a sense of interactivity and dynamism to the app's appeal.

## 📋 Disclaimer
This app uses flashing visual effects, that could potentially be hazardous to some users who can suffer from photo-sensitive epilepsy. Please use with caution.

## ✨ Features
* **Tournament selection** - allows you to choose from any 1 of golf's 4 major events. 
* **Player sorter** - allows users to select how they sort the order that their golfers are drawn to participants, through either a professional golfer's ranking or their tournament odds.
* **Participant entry** - where participants can enter their name and select from a choice of colours via a colour picker, that will represent their assigned players drawn in stage 2 and viewed on the live leaderboard in stage 3.
* **Automated player assignment spinner** - allows participants to do a full draw of the tournament's golf pros with the simple click of a button that randomly lands on the app's spinner wheel canvas.
* **Draw Results tracker** - view the results of the wheel spins in both the "current" round and "previous" round of player to participant assignment.
* **Live leaderboard** - track live updates of every participant's player; including leaderboard position, live score and hole number as players proceed through the real major event. 
* **Automated/Interactive polling** - keeps constant updates with calls to Slash Golf API every 15 minutes and can also be paused for unexpected events (such as inclement weather).
* **Late Entry field** - allows users to enter any players who replaced tournament withdrawals after the app's main draw has taken place.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **React** - components-based UI framework.
- **Vite** - build tool and local development server.
- **JavaScript** - core language code.
- **Slash Golf API** - live leaderboard data via RapidAPI.
- **The Odds API** - player odds data for draw sorting.
- **Flagcdn.com** - flag images via free CDN.
- **Vercel** - deployment and hosting.
- **Figma** - UI design and prototyping.


## ⚙️ Installation & usage

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Acemeistre/Portfolio-Project_Golf-sweepstake-app.git
cd Portfolio-Project_Golf-sweepstake-app
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
```
VITE_GOLF_SLASH_LEADERBOARDS_API_KEY=[your slash golf key]
VITE_ODDS_API_KEY=[your odds api key]
```

### Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Or visit the live app
[golf-sweepstake-app.vercel.app](https://golf-sweepstake-app.vercel.app/)

## ⚠️ Known limitations
- This app currently only works on each individual’s own browser, using local storage persistence and has no back end that can share polling or API updates with other friend’s devices.

- The API quota for polling is currently exhausted from the App's build phase - live leaderboard data remains unavailable as this time, due to this limitation and will reset on the 15th of July, 2026.

- The data for odds also met it’s quota during the app build (resets on July 1st, 2026), so there currently is no data available for the odds sort option.

- World rankings data is maintained via a static JSON file, last updated for the week of the U.S.Open 2026. 
A paid API such as DataGolf or Sportradar would automate this in a production environment.

- Automated polling windows are set to capture most of each tournament day, but may miss early day action (each day) due to limited API calls.

- Once the polling button is clicked to pause, users must manually unpause on the same respective day as this will over-ride automated polling windows.


## 🗺️ Roadmap

**The following points are the current pipeline of updates coming to future versions of the Golf Sweepstake app.**

**JULY ONWARDS**:
- Verify vite's hot reload feature stops firing the leaderboard API when making code updates.

- Build the fetch command for one off call to odds API data, storing it to a JSON file and also adding a time check to disable the command after the first tee times on day 1 of each tournament.

- Build "fetchField.js" script to grab the appropriate field of players for any given tournament.
    - Update app to filter players by "fetchfield.js".

- Odds restoration and fractional/decimal conversion.

- Change file name "playerCountries.json" to "playerData.json" and add boolean data for each major.
<br><br>

**REST OF YEAR:**
- Look into shared backend databases for sharing app/polling data on multiple devices.

- Add in a component of a key in stage 3, that visually represents the participant's name with their chosen colour.

- Add in a component that calculates the pay-out of a sweepstake break-down, based on total pot size and agreed placement pay-out amounts.

- Build a clean-up script for "playerCountries.json" (*later named "playerData.json"*) — compare existing entries against a fresh top-1000 world rankings to pull and remove players absent from the top 1000 - run ideally at the start of a new year.
    - Ensure previous major winner's data IS NOT wiped.

- Revisit disclaimer wording once the sweepstake payout calculator component is built — ensure language clearly distinguishes between friendly sweepstake tracking and regulated gambling.

## 🔧 Maintenance Requirements

- **Week leading to tournament** <br>
    - Execute the fetchRankings.js command to update "worldRankings.json".
    - Execute the fetchOdds.js command to update "oddsData.json" *(once built in July)*.
    - Execute the fetchField.js to save to a new (*yet to be named*) json file.
    - Manually add player's data to "playerCountries.json" (*later named "playerData.json"*) for those who get through regional qualification and outside the parameters of our saved data.

- **Yearly**
    - Update tournament dates & polling windows.
    - Execute the clean-up script to refresh the data for "playerCountries.json" (*later named "playerData.json"*).
